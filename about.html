                Hi, I am Haarish an 18 year old.I am pursuing Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
                in NIT Trichy.I just finished my first year in college.My interests include watching movies,
                tv series, chess, watching about companies and its marketing strategies, playing basketball.
                I am also a member of Toastmasters International.We work on improving our Leadership and 
                Public speaking skills.I must say college has been fun and serious at the same time.
                Fun when there are no exams and serious when it is semester exams.I must say though 
                I have been enjoying the freedom and friends that I got to make in college.
            </p>
                
            <p>During my first semester we had a professor called Oh I forgot his name.Ah yes raman sir 
                He was one of the most interesting professor I had ever met.He used simple life examplies and 
                always raised new interesting questions like if we were to mine the moon for resources what would so and so
                I enjoyed his teaching and he is one of the most friendly prof I have ever met.
