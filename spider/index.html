                Hi, I am Haarish an 18 year old.I am pursuing Metallurgy and Materials Engineering
                in NIT Trichy.I just finished my first year in college.My interests include watching movies,
                tv series, chess, watching about companies and its marketing strategies, playing basketball.
                I am also a member of Toastmasters International.We work on improving our Leadership and 
                Public speaking skills.I must say college has been fun and serious at the same time.
                Fun when there are no exams and serious when it is semester exams.I have been enjoying 
                the freedom and friends that I got to make in college.
